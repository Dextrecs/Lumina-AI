# 🌟 Lumina AI: Your Pocket Einstein ☝️🤓 (but with whatsapp style)

Listen, we all know the drill. You want an AI that doesn't look like a boring spreadsheet from 2005. You want that familiar "seen at 2:02 PM" energy. Enter **Lumina**—the Gemini-powered chat interface that looks so much like WhatsApp, your mom might accidentally text it asking where you are. (a very pro shitty desc 😎)

## 🛠️ What’s Under the Hood?

* **WhatsApp Core**: Bubbles, timestamps, and that "Online" status that makes it feel alive.
* **Brain Power**: It uses `gemini-1.5-flash`, so it's snappy, smart, and won't leave you on read.
* **Eyes Included**: Toss in an image, a video, or a PDF. Lumina sees it all.
* **The "Me" Factor**: Change the AI's name to "GigaChad" or "Bestie," swap the PFP, and give it custom instructions to be as sassy or as helpful as you want.
* **Night Owl Friendly**: Full Dark Mode support because we know you're using this at 3 AM.

## 🚀 How to Summon Lumina (IMPORTANT 👀)

### 1. The "Secret" Sauce
You need a Google Gemini API Key. If you don't have one, grab it at **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)**. It’s free, and it’s the fuel for this machine.

### 2. The Setup (No Coding Required, Trust)
1.  **Download** these files.
2.  **Open** `index.html` in your browser.
3.  **Paste** your API Key into the "Welcome" pop-up overlay.
4.  **Profit**.

## 💾 A Quick Heads-Up (The "Storage" Talk)

Lumina is a minimalist. It remembers your **text** forever (stored locally on your device), but it has a short memory for **media**.
* **Text**: Saved to `localStorage`. Refresh the page? It’s still there.
* **Pics/Videos**: Processed by the AI, but they won't stick around after a reload. Keep it light.
